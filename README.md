COURSEWORK 
Read the case study on Golden Star Ltd and then complete the required tasks. Golden Star Ltd is a private petrochemical company headquartered in the city of Qingdao, China. It is one of the so-called “teapot” oil refiners and operates two oil refineries along the coastline of Shandong province. Most of the petrochemical products produced by Golden Star Ltd are sold to domestic customers. Because the domestic economy of China is slowing down, the People’s Bank of China (the central bank) has started to ease its monetary policy to stimulate economic growth. Monetary easing is likely to cause devaluation of Chinese Yen again the US dollar and Euro, which are used by Golden Star Ltd to buy crude oil from foreign suppliers.All of the crude oil used by Golden Star Ltd are imported. Around 30% of the crude oil imports come from Iran and Russia; the rest are from Angola, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates. Currently, transactions with Iran and Russia have not been affected by the sanctions imposed by the US and EU because they are not settled in Euro or US dollar. However, there is a risk that in the future that the US and EU may tighten the sanctions on Iran and Russia. For example, if both regimes decide to strictly enforce secondary sanctions on the entities buying crude oil from Iran and Russia, Golden Star Ltd will have no choice but to stop importing crude oil from these two countries because its transactions with the other supplying nations are settled in US dollar or Euro. Also, the political instability in the Middle East and the on-going Russo-Ukraine conflict have made the global oil price more volatile in the past five years. For example, a drone attack to a major oil installation in Saudi Arabia in 2019 caused a benchmark oil price, the Brent Crude Futures price, to increase by almost 20% in two days.In the past two years, Golden Star Ltd has been working with a local university to improve the refining process used in its refineries. The CEO of Golden Star Ltd plans to introduce an improved refining process in the next three months. If this process is successfully implemented, the yield on high-value-added products, such as gasoline, will increase by 10%. However, past experience suggests that the implementation of a new process is not always smooth. For example, at the early stage of the implementation, Golden Star may encounter temporary disruptions to the normal production in its refineries.Golden Star Ltd did not have any major accident in the past 5 years. However, recent inspections of its refineries and warehouses by local authorities identified several deficiencies in its compliance with the local health and safety regulations. Some of the deficiencies, if not quickly addressed, may lead to catastrophic accidents, such as fires and explosions. Local authorities fined Golden Star CNY 2 million for the compliance issues and required it to take immediate actions to improve its compliance.Required Tasks Task 1 Use the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) model to analyze the potential failures in the supply chain of Golden Star Ltd:a)   Identify the failure types and the potential cause(s) and effect(s) of the failures.  [20 marks] b)   Estimate and then rank the Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs) of the potential failures identified in a). Note that you should justify the ratings assigned to the three components of RPNs (i.e., Occurrence, Severity and Detectability). [20 marks] c)   Recommend some control measures that could reduce the ratings of the three components of RPNs calculated in b) and then re-estimate the RPNs, assuming that your recommended measures will be successfully implemented. [20 marks] Task 2 Apart from the potential risks revealed by the case study, identify any two potential ESG risks in the supply chain of a petrochemical company like Golden Star Ltd and then briefly discuss how to mitigate these risks.
